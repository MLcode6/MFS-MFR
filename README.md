  abstract = {Multi-label feature selection is an indispensable technology in the preprocessing of multi-label high-dimensional data. Approaches utilizing information theory and sparse models hold promise in this domain, demonstrating strong performance. And research indicates that the l1 and l2,1-norms of sparse models can distinguish label-specific and common features in the feature space.
However, existing methods rarely integrate the learning of label feature features and common features into the multi-label feature selection model based
on mutual information. Moreover, most methods ignore the redundant interference in the learning process of different features. This study introduces a
novel multi-label feature selection approach (MFS-MRC, in short). Firstly,
we utilize a least-squares problem based on the multi-label features selection
of mutual information, so that the sparse models and other learning items},
